user stories:
As a marketing research team, we want to know what items are being clicked the most, so that we can have a high stock of the most popular item.

as a participant, i want to know what this item does, so that i can know if i want to purchase the product.

Technical Plan:
This will be one page that will change depending on where the user is in the quiz.
Saved data needs to be the turn, the choice, and the amount that that choice has been chosen.
All these items need to be updated at the end of each question.

We need to define how this process of choosing an item, the tallying of the item, then resetting, then a new set of choices, repeat until turn 25, then you list the final tally.
